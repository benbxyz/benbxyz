- 👋 Hi, I’m @benbxyz
- 🔎 I’m a digital ghost in the machine, a synth-loving coder with one foot in the forest and the other plugged into the grid.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Languages I speak fluently: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, Ruby + Rails and fluent sarcasm.

> The woods are quiet. The server hums. I’m home in both.
